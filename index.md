# About

This site is personal. It's mostly for me to digest what I am working on in a non-professional capacity. Over the years, there have been many projects and technologies I've sought to learn and never have. A little public accountatibility, even if not easily findable might help me progress. I've read that setting a low bar is great to get started and if I posted every other month, near the top of the month, I would be happy. With 6 or so days left until May 1st, 2021, that hopefully leaves me enough time to set this static site and jot down my first endeavor.
